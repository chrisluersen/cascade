# Getting started (no experience needed)

New to AI and not sure what any of this means? Start here. This page explains what
cascade is, the handful of words you'll see everywhere, and how to send your very
first message — step by step.

## What is cascade, in one sentence?

It's a **free middleman** between your program and AI models. Your program asks it a
question; it quietly finds a free AI provider that's available and gets you an answer —
switching to another provider automatically if one is busy or rate-limited.

**An analogy:** imagine a phone operator with a stack of calling cards from different
networks. You ask to make a call; the operator tries one card, and if it's out of minutes,
instantly tries the next — you never get a busy signal. cascade is that operator, and
the "cards" are free API keys from providers like Google Gemini, Groq, and others.

## Why would I want it?

- **It's free.** It uses the free tiers of many AI providers.
- **It doesn't go down.** When one provider hits its limit, it falls back to another, so
  your app keeps working.
- **It's a drop-in.** If you already use code that talks to OpenAI or Anthropic, you change
  *one line* (the address) and it works.

## Words you'll keep seeing

You don't need to memorize these — skim them, and come back when one shows up. There's a
fuller list in **[concepts.md](concepts.md)**.

- **LLM** (Large Language Model) — the actual AI "brain" that reads text and writes a reply
  (e.g. GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama).
- **API key** — a secret password that lets your program use a provider. You get these free
  from the providers (see **[providers.md](providers.md)**).
- **Provider** — a company that hosts LLMs you can call over the internet (Gemini, Groq…).
- **Token** — roughly ¾ of a word. AI usage and limits are measured in tokens.
- **Prompt** — the text you send to the AI.

## Step 1 — Install it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisluersen/cascade/main/get.sh | bash
```

This downloads cascade and adds a `cascade` command to your terminal.

## Step 2 — Add your first free key

Run the friendly setup wizard:

```bash
cascade setup
```

It will ask which provider you have a key for and walk you through it. Don't have one yet?
**Gemini** is the easiest and most generous — get a free key at
[aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), then paste it when asked. (More options
in **[providers.md](providers.md)**.)

## Step 3 — Check it's running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8319/health
```

You should see `{"status":"ok",...}`. That means cascade is up and listening.

## Step 4 — Send your first message

cascade understands the same "language" as the popular OpenAI library, so any OpenAI
example works — you just point it at cascade. Install the library and run this:

```bash
pip install openai
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# api_key here is cascade's own password (default "sk-cascade-1"), NOT a provider key.
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8319/v1", api_key="sk-cascade-1")

reply = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="cascade",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain what an AI agent is, simply."}],
)
print(reply.choices[0].message.content)
```

Run it — you just made your first AI call, for free, through cascade. 🎉
